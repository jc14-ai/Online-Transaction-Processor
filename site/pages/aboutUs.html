            <div class="likod_salita">Kofei began when Paolo R. Reyes decided to take a step into the world of
              business by purchasing a branch of an established donut and coffee brand. While the donuts are not
              handmade, Paolo saw it as the perfect opportunity to explore passive income and learn how to run a
              business from the ground up. What started as a business move soon became a passion—serving quality
              products and sharing smiles, one cup and bite at a time.</div>
