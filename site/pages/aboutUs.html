                Kofai began when Paolo R. Reyes decided to take a step into the
                world of business by purchasing a branch of an established donut
                and coffee brand. While the donuts are not handmade, Paolo saw
                it as the perfect opportunity to explore passive income and
                learn how to run a business from the ground up. What started as
                a business move soon became a passion—serving quality products
                and sharing smiles, one cup and bite at a time.
